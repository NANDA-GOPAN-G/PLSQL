Create a stored procedure called add_department that inserts a new department into the departments table.
The procedure should take the following 2 parameters: p_department_id and p_department_name.
If you are using livesql please make a copy of the department table first.

/*

CREATE TABLE my_hr_departments AS

SELECT * FROM hr.departments ;

*/

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_department (



    p_department_id IN my_hr_departments.department_id%TYPE,



    p_department_name IN my_hr_departments.department_name%TYPE



) IS



BEGIN



    INSERT INTO  my_hr_departments (department_id, department_name)



    VALUES (p_department_id, p_department_name);



    COMMIT;



EXCEPTION



    WHEN DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX THEN



        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deparment ID ' || p_department_id || ' already exists.');

ROLLBACK;



    WHEN OTHERS THEN



       DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred: ' || SQLERRM);

   ROLLBACK;



END;



/*

Calling your stored procedure

CALL add_department(1000,'TEST1');

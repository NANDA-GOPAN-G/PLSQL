1) Create a copy of employees table from the hr schema and call the table my_hr_employees.

CREATE TABLE my_hr_employees AS
SELECT *
FROM hr.employees;


2) Create a PL/SQL block that inserts an employee to the table my_hr_employees with the following attributes:
employee_id with value of 3000;
first_name with value of 'Jane';
last_name with value of 'Smith';
email with value of 'JS@udemy.com'
hire_date with value of SYSDATE
job_id with value of 'Marketing'
v_salary with value of 45,000;

DECLARE
  v_employee_id my_hr_employees.employee_id%TYPE := 3000;
  v_first_name my_hr_employees.first_name%TYPE := 'Jane';
  v_last_name my_hr_employees.last_name%TYPE := 'Smith';
  v_email my_hr_employees.email%TYPE := 'JS@udemy.com';
  v_hire_date my_hr_employees.hire_date%TYPE := SYSDATE;
  v_job_id my_hr_employees.job_id%TYPE := 'Marketing';
  v_salary my_hr_employees.salary%TYPE := 45000;

BEGIN
  INSERT INTO my_hr_employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name,email,hire_date,job_id,salary)
  VALUES (v_employee_id, v_first_name, v_last_name,v_email,v_hire_date,v_job_id,v_salary);

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee inserted successfully.');

END;

3) Create a PL/SQL block that updates salary for an employee with employee_id of 3000 to salary of 50,000. Use table my_hr_employees we created at step 1.

DECLARE
  v_employee_id my_hr_employees.employee_id%TYPE := 3000;
  v_new_salary my_hr_employees.salary%TYPE := 50000;
BEGIN
  UPDATE my_hr_employees
  SET salary = v_new_salary
  WHERE employee_id = v_employee_id;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee salary updated successfully.');

END;

4) Create a PL/SQL block that selects an employee with employee_id of 3000 and prints first_name , last_name and salary to the screen. Use table my_hr_employees we created at step 1.

DECLARE
  v_employee_id my_hr_employees.employee_id%TYPE := 3000;
  v_first_name my_hr_employees.first_name%TYPE;
  v_last_name my_hr_employees.last_name%TYPE;
  v_salary my_hr_employees.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
  SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
  INTO v_first_name, v_last_name, v_salary
  FROM my_hr_employees
  WHERE employee_id = v_employee_id;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name: ' || v_first_name || ' ' || v_last_name);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Salary: ' || v_salary);

END;

5) Create a PL/SQL block that delete salary for an employee with employee of 3000.Use table my_hr_employees we created at step 1.

DECLARE
  v_employee_id my_hr_employees.employee_id%TYPE := 3000;
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM my_hr_employees
  WHERE employee_id = v_employee_id;

  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee deleted successfully.');

END;
